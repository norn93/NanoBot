# ANDRIS - AutoNomous Driving Robotic Interactive System: An Open-source Arduino Nano based Robot 

ANDRIS is an educational platform for highschool and university students to use to learn about robot hardware and software.

* Deprecated: Old files tagged for deletion
* Hardware: KiCad PCB designs and libraries
* Libraries: Contains the most up to date versions of the different libraries we use
	* Debug: Library for debugging code, and for testing
	* NanoBot: The current official release
* Results: Part of our ongoing debugging and testing for the library
* Programs: Contains some example programs which make use of the NanoBot library
	* robot_move_commands: A basic sketch for Alfie. Control the robot via bluetooth and keyboard. 

## Hardware todo:
* Revise PCB to version 1.0
	
## Software todo:
* Edit library: it should only include the bare minimum it needs to function, and it should be commented clearly
